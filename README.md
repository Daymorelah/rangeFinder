# Range Finder.

A simple program that implements interfacing an ultrasonic sensor or range finder with a micro-controller. 

This simple program interfaces an ultrasonic sensor with an atmel 8-bit ATmega32 microcontroller. It uses a 16 by 2
LCD to display the range or distance measured.

All port numbers used to interface are well commented in the source code.The souce code is written with
[Atmel Sudio v6](http://www.atmel.com/tools/atmelstudio.aspx).

You can get the datasheet for the micro-controller used here [ATmega-32 Datasheet](http://www.atmel.com/images/Atmel-8271-8-bit-AVR-Microcontroller-ATmega48A-48PA-88A-88PA-168A-168PA-328-328P_datasheet_Complete.pdf).
